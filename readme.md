# Hi I am Nayanika Das

I am a researcher specializing in protein engineering, structural biology, protein illustration, and computational chemistry, with a focus on the evolutionary and epistatic analysis of the mutational landscape in Glutathione Peroxidase Protein. Driven by a passion for connecting science with art, I leverage my experience in editorial processes, scientific and non-scientific presentations, and collaborative research to foster effective communication and inspire innovation across disciplines.
